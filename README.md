Android webview + Accelerometer + Javacript little game
=======================================================

I needed to implement this example as a test for my work, it uses the Android webview plus accelerometer features in order to pass signals to a javascript function and finally renders an small game.
The game framework used is called Phaser, very easy to use and to learn.
